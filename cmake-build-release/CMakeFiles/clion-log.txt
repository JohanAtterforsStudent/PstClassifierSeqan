CMake Error at src/CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindSeqAn3.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "SeqAn3", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "SeqAn3" with any
  of the following names:

    SeqAn3Config.cmake
    seqan3-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "SeqAn3" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "SeqAn3_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "SeqAn3"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
